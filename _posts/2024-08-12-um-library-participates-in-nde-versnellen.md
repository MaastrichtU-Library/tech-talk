### IIIF

The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is a set of open standards that is widely used by cultural
heritage institutions to facilitate sharing, displaying and annotation of high-resolution digital images.
It allows users to access, compare, and interact with images across various platforms seamlessly.
IIIF consists of a set of APIs that deliver functionality.

### Omeka S

Omeka S is a web publishing platform designed for institutions to manage and share digital collections and exhibits. It
supports linked data, enabling the creation of interconnected content across multiple sites, making it ideal for
collaborative projects and multi-institutional archives.

### NDE Versnellen

The Dutch Digital Heritage Network (NL: Netwerk Digitaal Erfgoed, NDE) is the main driving force for the
Dutch [national strategy for digital heritage](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/activiteiten/nationale-strategie-digitaal-erfgoed/).
In 2023 NDE launched a concept called "NDE compatibel werken" to make digital heritage content available and connected.
The concept consists of five key aspects:

1. Use of [persistent identifiers](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/activiteiten/duurzame-identifiers-bij-de-bron/)
2. Link to URIs of standardized terms via the NDE [Network of Terms](https://termennetwerk.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/)
3. Publish heritage information as [linked (open) data](https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/activiteiten/linked-data-2/)
4. Make datasets discoverable by others via the [Dataset Registry](https://datasetregister.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/)
5. Use [IIIF](https://netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed.github.io/requirements-collection-management-systems/) for access to
   image collections.

The Dutch Digital Heritage Network is supporting heritage organisations to move to NDE compatible systems with their
subsidy program called [NDE Versnellen](Dutch Digital Heritage Network). Maastricht University Library participated in
this call for proposals in 2023 with a project to implement IIIF functionalities on top of their Omeka S instance and 
becoming fully NDE-compliant.
